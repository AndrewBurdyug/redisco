version 0.2.0
-------------
Lot of changes :
* DateTime objects are now TimeZone aware. They will store time in UTC. If you
don't specify any TZ, your local timezone will be assumed.
* List objects (for now) behaves like Python List.
* Optimization of Key Deletion when filtering.
* Dropped Base64 encoding as Redis is binary safe nowadays. Keys can now be
encoded in utf-8
* Unittests update
* speed : Fixed a bug where the filtered objects where sorted twice
* speed : Objects are now fetched entirely at first (except for Counters)
* speed : Refactor native redis object calls. The DELEGATEABLE_METHOD turned
out to be pretty inefficient
* speed : Optimization for caching (and returning) objects

version 0.1.3
-------------
* Initial version from the previous maintainers
from https://github.com/iamteem/redisco)
